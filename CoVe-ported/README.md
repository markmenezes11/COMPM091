# Context Vectors (CoVe) - Keras Port, Ported to Python2

This folder contains a variation of the [Keras port](https://github.com/rgsachin/CoVe) of [CoVe](https://github.com/salesforce/cove) (see `LICENSE`).

The script `port_python3_to_python2.py` takes the [Keras port](https://github.com/rgsachin/CoVe) of [CoVe](https://github.com/salesforce/cove) and converts it into a Python2-compatible version.
